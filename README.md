CloudKit meets CoreData. 
CKSIncrementalStore is a subclass of [NSIncrementalStore](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/CoreData/Reference/NSIncrementalStore_Class/index.html) which automatically maintains a SQLite local cache (using CoreData) of userâ€™s private data on CloudKit Servers and keeps it in sync.</p>

### Let's add it

```swift
var coordinator: NSPersistentStoreCoordinator? = NSPersistentStoreCoordinator(managedObjectModel:self.managedObjectModel)
let url = self.applicationDocumentsDirectory.URLByAppendingPathComponent("CKSIncrementalStore_iOSDemo.sqlite")
var error: NSError? = nil
var failureReason = "There was an error creating or loading the application's saved data."
  
var persistentStore:NSPersistentStore? = coordinator!.addPersistentStoreWithType(CKSIncrementalStore.type, configuration: nil, URL: url, options: nil, error: &error)

if persistentStore != nil
{
    self.cksIncrementalStore = persistentStore as? CKSIncrementalStore
    // Its best to have a property for the IncrementalStore
}

```
#### Did I mentioned Sync earlier !

Yes! CKSIncrementalStore automatically keeps the data in sync with the CloudKit servers. There are two ways to do that.
But first if you want to know when the sync operation starts and finishes subcribe to these two notifications
##### Notifications
* <b>CKSIncrementalStoreDidStartSyncOperationNotification</b>

Notification is posted when the sync operation starts.

`Example`

```swift
NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter().addObserver(self, selector: "syncFinished:", name: CKSIncrementalStoreDidStartSyncOperationNotification, object: self.cksIncrementalStore)

```
* <b>CKSIncrementalStoreDidFinishSyncOperationNotification</b>

Notification is posted when the sync operation finishes.

`Example`

```swift
NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter().addObserver(self, selector: "syncFinished:", name: CKSIncrementalStoreDidFinishSyncOperationNotification, object: self.cksIncrementalStore)
```
##### Ways to Sync
* <b>Manual Sync</b>

Anytime call triggerSync() on an instance of CKSIncrementalStore.

```swift
self.cksIncrementalStore.triggerSync()
```
* <b>Automatic Sync</b>

Well anytime you call save on an instance of `NSManagedObjectContext`, CKSIncrementalStore calls `triggerSync()` automatically. 

But what if some other device changes some records on the server. Don't worry we have you covered but we need some of your help too.

Enable [Push Notifications](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/setting-up-push-notifications-on-ios--cms-21925) for your app. Then in your AppDelegate's method

```swift
func application(application: UIApplication, didReceiveRemoteNotification userInfo: [NSObject : AnyObject]) 
{
    self.cksIncrementalStore?.handlePush(userInfo: userInfo)
}
```
#### Sync Conflicts

Life is usually filled up with conflicts and so is data. The good thing about "data" is that we can easily resolve conflicts using libraries like this one.


`CKSIncrementalStore supports 4 sync conflict resolution policies out of the box.`

* <b>GreaterModifiedDateWins</b>

This is the default. Record with the greater modified date is considered to be the true record.

* <b>UserTellsWhichWins</b>

Setting this sync policy requires that you set the `recordConflictResolutionBlock` instance of `CKSIncrementalStore`.

```swift
var recordConflictResolutionBlock:((clientRecord:CKRecord,serverRecord:CKRecord)->CKRecord)?
```
It gives you two versions of the record. Client record and Server record. You do what ever changes you want on the server record and return it.

* <b>ServerRecordWins</b>

It simply considers the Server record as the true record.

* <b>ClientRecordWins</b>

It simply considers the Client record as the true record.

You can set any policy by passing it as an option while adding `CKSIncrementalStore` to `NSPersistentStoreCoordinator`.

```swift
var options:Dictionary<NSObject,AnyObject> = Dictionary<NSObject,AnyObject>()
options[CKSIncrementalStoreSyncConflictPolicyOption] = NSNumber(short: CKSStoresSyncConflictPolicy.ClientRecordWins.rawValue)
var persistentStore:NSPersistentStore? = coordinator!.addPersistentStoreWithType(CKSIncrementalStore.type, configuration: nil, URL: url, options: options, error: &error)
```
### What it does support

CKSIncrementalStore supports only user's CloudKit `Private Database` at this time. It creates and uses a custom zone to store data and fetch changes from the server.

### What it does not support

CloudKit `Public Database` and here's the two reasons why, straight from the docs.

1. [The disadvantage of using the default zone for storing records is that it does not have any special capabilities. You cannot save a group of records to iCloud atomically in the default zone. Similarly, you cannot use a CKFetchRecordChangesOperation object on records in the default zone.](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/CloudKit/Reference/CKRecordZone_class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/clm/CKRecordZone/defaultRecordZone)

2. [ You cannot create custom zones in a public database.](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/CloudKit/Reference/CKRecordZone_class/index.html#//apple_ref/c/tdef/CKRecordZoneCapabilities)

## Getting Started 
See the sample iOS demo app. Run it on two devices and start adding, removing and modifying records and experience the magic.

## Installation
`CocoaPods` is the recommended way of adding CKSIncrementalStore to your project.

You want to to add pod `'CKSIncrementalStore', '~> 0.5.1'` similar to the following to your Podfile:
```
target 'MyApp' do
  pod 'CKSIncrementalStore', '~> 0.5.1'
end
```

Then run a `[sudo] pod install` inside your terminal, or from CocoaPods.app.
